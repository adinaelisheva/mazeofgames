Helper for 8 of Spades

Usage:

To print out every combo of base and divine metals:
`> node forge.js`

To print out one base combined with every divine:
`> node forge.js [base index in list]`
`> node forge.js [BASE WORD]`

To print out one base combined with every divine, with a specific letter filled in:
`> node forge.js [base] [letter]`

`usedDivines` stores words to be skipped in future iterations.

This doesn't contain all the metals because I made it when I was partially done so I only included the ones I had yet to solve. Sorry.
